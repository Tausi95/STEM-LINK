      <h2>About ASSETHub</h2>
      <p>
        ASSETHub is a platform dedicated to connecting STEM professionals
        with mentorship and career development opportunities. This project is part of
        ASSET's curriculum, showcasing real-world skills and a passion for building 
	innovative solutions in Science and Mathematics. 

	  ASSET as an organisation will streamline one of its programmes using the APP: 
	  The LDP is two-fold, namely:

	  Grade 12 programme and
	  The Maths and Science programme (for grades 8 -11)
	  For both programmes, suitably qualified tutors are contracted by ASSET to run sessions on identified Saturdays for the duration of the program throughout the year.

	  All learners receive stationery; subject supporting learning materials and a full hot meal every Saturday that has been prepared in partnership with the host centre school.

	  There is a huge focus in mental preparedness mostly for grade 11 and 12 learners through career awareness â€“ mentorship and role modelling sessions. 
	  Additional enhancement to learning is done via holiday camps, revision workshops, winter and spring schools. This project Aims at enhancing ASSET reachness and effectivenes in 
	  its programming.
